75 East Harmon Avenue,"Resorts,Hotels Motels,Hotel",Las Vegas,36.1075,-115.1693,Marriott's Grand Chateau,89109,NV,September,5,"We stayed on this time share property thru a family member. We stayed on a corner 2 bedroom suite with views of other casino buildings on the strip. Check-in and out was quick with no lines. Staff members are friendly and accommodating. Our room was clean and has all the amenities for a typical condo time share property. My kids did not attend the children's program /play ground but we always see kids with attendants on the play area every morning from our room. The pool was small and I wish it was larger considering that it is a time share property and most of their guests are families with kids. Parking (valet only) is free which is great considering that MGM properties on the strip charged for parking. My main complaint is the long wait for getting our car. We always waited for at least 15 minutes or longer to get our car. The longest was during our check our which is around 10:00 AM when we waited at least 40 minutes, I guess its the check out time.We are delighted that you found our associates friendly and accommodating. We appreciate your feedback of your stay. Thank you for your perfect review of Marriott's Grand Chateau.",California

This was our first time ever to stay at our home property. The service was wonderful, the staff pleasant, and the suites beautiful. It wa a wonderful stay. Two critiques, 1. the movie that was played in the evening was rated PG13, and our small children 3 and 6 were not able to stay in the pool because of it, and when we went to the other pool, it was a lot of young adults smoking and drinking.Thank you for a perfect review, Cat!

Stayed in a very nice 2 bedroom 2 bath unit plenty of room for the 2 of us. The staff was fantastic. 2 pool areas, one on the 5th floor and the other was on the 387h floor, roof top. Both has full bars and served food.. Location was a half block from the Strip, across the street from Planet Hollywood. Lounge in the lobby and a deli. Would definitely stay there againMichael, we are so happy to hear you are enjoying your Ownership. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a perfect review.
