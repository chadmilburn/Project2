The air conditioner didn't seem to keep the room cool, it was warm. When we let the front desk know, they did NOTHING to fix the issues. We would NOT stay at this hotel again, it was inexpensive but now we know why it is inexpensive."

There was still trash in the bathroom when we checked in. Housekeeping did not want to send anyone to take out the trash or bring more towels. The towels were frayed. Our non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke. There was no coffee maker. Our receipt from hotels.com said there was room service, but there was no room service. We forgot an item, but when we called to see if they found it and could return it, we were told, Sorry, the lost and found is only open M-F, 8-5. Not one employee acted as if we were in any way valued guests. I'm glad we only stayed the one night. I will never stay there again and I will tell everyone I know about the horrible time we had there."

I didn't see any but the bites continued. then I woke up with full on hives all over my stomach and chest, I never had hives before. house keeping didn't come by until after one each day so I decided to just make up the bed myself and clean. but the 3rd day I called in the morning left for the day and came back from the pool after one and still no house keeping so I had to call again. front desk called me 2 times in the middle of the night once to ask me a question that could have waited till morning and the second was a mistake both about 2 am when I was asleep because it was our last night. we check in on a Thursday and they only had 2 people doing check in up to sunday, sunday is the first time I saw 4 people behind the desk doing check in.

I asked to be moved to another room and I was refused. Question is it due to the fact we are Japanese Plus had to pay for resort FEE must be for the banging door Would you yourself want the room of the sound of the banging door.

I found a lot of hair on the bed when we first got there. It was very gross and disturbing. The bathrooms were not so clean as well. Maybe if the hotel room was more clean it would have been a better experience.

The room itself was fine. The 24/7 fitness room was locked when I got there, and my room key did not open it. Stayed only one night, and left in the morning."

Casino carpet was dirty, torn and tattered... as was my room. No coffee maker, sink would not drain, tub was super slippery and shower curtain rod was broken. There were no hooks or towel rods inthe bathroom. Bed was hard and the window was dirty with dead bugs in window sill. No brochure on hotel amenities, dining options or room service. McDonald's in the food court served me an egg mcmuffin with runny egg whites. Had to pay to park, then had to give the guard at the parking exit all my info just to leave because I didn't have a room key. I had just checked out!"

Frustrating until we learned the right people who had the time and information to help us. Those people where amazing! 1 person for our 3 days that was helpful at each of these locations. Front desk day 3, rewards card day 3, housekeeping day 3, bartender day 3. Got our coupon book on day 3 before the flight and I finally played some tables. These customer service issues aren't a problem for us as we now know how to deal with it but I worry for your over all customer base. Attention and patience with each person, and if you don't know help them find out how to find the I formation. That's all. We will be back:)"

You can tell the hotel is a bit older and they have done renovations on it. Some items, like the elevator and furniture in the rooms show clear signs of wear but not terribly so. The pool is great and so is the casino in the lobby. Free breakfast is not included, but there are a lot of restaurants in the hotel."

Always like Fremont Street for people watching and all the shows going on! A great vibe with folks from all over, friendly and vibrant. The pool was redone and very nice.

When we checked in the staff was severely overloaded, there were two people at the front desk and probably 100 people checking in.

Pretty cool. Parking is free once you check in and they'll reimburse the money you used to enter the first time. Bathroom had no window which was weird but got used to it. The best part was live bands playing at the pool. Freakin Angelic upstarts played for free. Dope

It looks like it's stuck in the 70's. You can see where some remodeling has been done and is continuing to be done - but keeping up appearances doesn't seem to be urgent. The pool is okay (good for wading) but will deteriorate over time. It's overrun with children and likely local guests. The hallways also had a not so fresh scent. My room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort. As someone who enjoys spending time in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh! Didn't try the dining options - I recommend eating at Main Street Station for the buffet. Casino floor is very smoky. Obviously right at the Fremont experience if that is what you are looking for. Will likely never stay here again.

During special times like around New Year's, where bands are playing all the time, it might be loud....that was my experience at the D, the Grand, and another hotel. I cannot guarantee it won't be loud here too I just don't know.) Anyway, no complaints. at all."

There was no breakfast as indictated, we had to find a restaurant. The building was renovated but there was a wrapper stuck to the window behind the currents overlooking the Fremont Experience block. The north wing takes a different elevator than the south wing. The parking garage has its own elevator that you must use which is on the opposite end of the plaza from where the elevators are you must use to get to your rooms. The kiosk to check in for yiur flights was down, but the check in people helped in printing out our tickets in their office. Everyone was polite and professional. Plenty of gambling and place to eat nearby. It is located 25 minutes from the airport."

Would have been nice to have small refrig. and microwave paid extra for small refrig. (brought up right away). Towels and wash cloths were limited, but soon as I called for extra, housekeeping came up quickly and delivered. The hotel was not posh, and a bit old, but the service was great, the room was clean and smoke free. The Greyhound bus station is literally next door and appeared derelict free.

Received a call from chase and asked if i made several purchases the next morning and that is how i discovered the breech. Please start using the chip, such a stronger platform and helps prevent things like this. I'm not upset with the hotel for the hack, however measures should be taken to protect your customers."

The leaking cooler, they didn't get back to us because, they were going to send someone up to take a look at it, but my husband and son were still sleeping. This is like 8am. So they said let us know when. We left to meet our Realtor. So we didn't let them know and by the time we got back. We were too tired from everything. But at least they could've called our room and asked if we still needed the cooler checked. The had our numbers also. I mean would think that they would note it down on the the computer. No fridge in the room, if you want one, it's 20 a day. No microwave. No view of Las Vegas. The only is concrete walls. If you want a view of Las Vegas. 20 extra. We had to pay 10 to park in the garage, the first time. Later I asked the front desk if we had to pay but, they reimburse us. Later I asked if we had to pay every time we parked in the garage.

When I went to the front desk first thing in the morning, I was told, Sorry, but since you booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do. Well--the 3rd party didn't assign me that room with the faulty AC unit (one that looked like it had not been cleaned or maintained in years). The Plaza did that. After getting to my new room, and comparing the AC units--it was like I was given the faulty room specifically because I booked through a 3rd party, that way if I complained all they had to say was, Sorry, but since you booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do.

The hotel is being renovated and I was in a newly renovated room. If you don't mind the basics and care more about the price then this might work for you. The room itself was half renovated--one of the chairs was old and gross but the room is pretty basic. It's like a fancy Motel 6. My friend was on a budget otherwise I definitely would not have stayed here. The pool was closed--was only open to some people but the guy who worked there wouldn't even let me look through the glass door at the pool. He was rude. I asked if I could look through the glass door to check out their new pool and he said no the pool was closed--it was five minutes to 7 and they close at 7. Yikes. The fire alarm went off when we were there. One of the staff told us we could ignore it. My friend was concerned so we went to the front desk to find out. No one would talk to us and we had to wait to get someone's attention. It took a long time before we found out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear. BTW the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter. They seem sad to work there.

I loved the size of the room as well, the only things i didn't like was the bad smell at the bottom of the elevator. It smelled like BO. Another thing is when checking out to get an elevator takes like 30 mins to an hour and the stairs isn't an option when you're on the 12th floor. Everything else was good. I didn't like that our bed sheets had some dirty spots on them."

Did not like the access to the parking garage, when staying in the North Tower. Liked the convenience of all the restaurants. Didn't like that the pool was only open until 7pm. The hotel staff was friendly. Didn't like having to pay the resort fees in addition to the room price. It should be included in the negotiated rate. The beds were very comfortable. The A/C worked awesome, since it was so hot.....108 in the day/ 98 in the night. Maintenance came quickly for a clogged toilet. Overall it was great, we had fun not worrying about the small stuff."

I knew my boyfriend and I were not going to be in the hotel very long, so I didn't expect 5 star, but I didn't want a 1 star dirty Motel 6 either. I chose this hotel because 70 for a deluxe king sounded great. Photos looked great and looked modern. We arrived at the hotel around 10pm, and waited in line for 15 minutes to check in. Upon checking in, the lady at the desk said they had no king beds available, as booked, but only 2 double beds. Fine. When we got in the room... one of the lamps was unplugged, and we shortly discovered the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging/unplugging it. The 2 double beds had 2 small square pillows each... definitely had to double them, and use 2 each. Horrible view, onto a roof with some AC unit type things. windows did not open, however there were handles and some cracked caulk on it."

First they didnt bother accommodating us with 1 bed (couple) and instead gave us 2 smaller beds. (We were there during the week and there were many available rooms). The front desk was rude ( I assume they get nasty from dealing with people but all we did was ask a simple question and they were rude about it). The bathtub was clogged, we asked to unclog it and they left a mess without cleaning it up. Dirt all over the tub, and it gets worse. The bathtub still remained clogged after their snaking attempt. The lights in the room are bad, they only had 2 lamps and no ceiling light so room remained with little light. THEY CHARGE A HIDDEN FEE! We stayed for 3 nights and we got charged 82 in extra fees without warning. We have stayed in many hotels before and they usually warn us when there are parking fees or any fees. This hotel did not mention any extra fees. The elevator was disgusting, someone urinated all over the inside of elevator."

Housekeeping and the headband of security were great about the whole thing going and accommodated me burn it was still a bummer. Other than that, the Plaza hotel and our stay was great!"

Check in was a huge mess lines were so ridiculous. My friend and I both each got rooms in at least 3 months and advance and we each got a room with one king bed, rather than two rooms each with two double beds like we asked for. They did not tell us that they gave us different rooms at check in, so we found out once we got to our rooms. I called room service and front desk and all that they said was it was booked up so they couldn't give either of double beds hung up on me. Had to call again to ask for a roll in bed, since I didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me. They only had one and so my friend didn't get one but luckily i did for my room. And the lady on the phone in room service was really rude and short with me. Elevator situation was a disaster, especially after the festival. I think only a couple of them worked and stair access was not really existent unless for emergency exiting. They also refused late checkout saying they were booked the next day even though they messed up my reservation. The new pool was pretty nice and clean and well put together. Though most of the pool is in shade by noon from its own hotel building of the plaza. Cleanliness and location were fine. I'll probably consider a different hotel next time. I've had a way better experience at Golden Nugget in the past, so I'll probably choose to go there instead if I want to stay DT."

Some how they only had one person to check every one. For the price we paid, I was expecting a better experience... The only reason I booked that room was because it had a tub/shower however, the tub was dirty, I could not even used it( We had no tv remote control in the room and the hallway stank badly!! The casino was nice, but no one came up to offer us a drink. The restaurant was ok, the food was marginal. The best part was walking around the neighborhood, it is a great location!! We walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was still going strong... Checking out next morning was a nightmare, people complaining of various situations and still having to wait in line for awhile, this time at least they had 2 people at the front desk! They never asked how our stay was, and when I mentioned we had no tv remote in the room the guy said oh well, maybe the last guest just took it I don't like to complain and understand sometimes things happens, but come on...

Upon finally making it to the counter the lady who is helping us coughs on our credit cards and says that she thinks she's getting sick because she has the chills. WHAT THE HECK!! Thanks for your contaminating our stuff you virus on legs! Once we finally got to our room in the 17th floor we immediately washed our hands and face so we wouldn't sick only to find that the bathroom hadn't been restocked with towels!

As I was taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off. I reset the button on the electrical wall receptical turned on the light and it immediately turned off as if there was a short in the electrical system. I called the front desk and explained to the receptionist the issue I was having. She said that she had to email a tech to come in for repairs and when I asked her how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know. Due to minimal sunlight into the bathroom I had no other choice but to shower in complete darkness. I was in Vegas for a family reunion so I was gone most of that day and about 3hrs after I left the room I got a call from the front desk to inform me that there was a water leak in my room and that they were moving us to the room next door. What scared me the most was the fact that the water leak might have been causing the light to short out and that there might have been a possibility of getting electrocuted while I was showering. The next two days that I stood there I was uncomfortable showering. I would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay there again.

The reason why is they would not valet park my Mercedes Sprinter van. So I had to park at there overflow parking lot down the street. I have no problem with parking there UNTIL I find out they charged me 20.00 a day on top of my room cost. The manager said she could do nothing about the parking charges. And just a note they had oversized spots in the valet lot.

On our way through the casino floor security tool me to the front desk and evicted me from the hotel for prostitution. I have never been so hurt in my life, I had book our rooms a month in advance for 2 nights, I am a certified caregiver in Washington state. I asked TO SPEAK with the manager who did nothing. We were parked on the garage fifth floor and I had to carry all my luggage as I could not walk on the casino floor. They did not refund any of our money or even say they were sorry, I asked them to show me the video of the casino floor and was told they have no audio. I left crying and I will never return and thanks to there rude and unprofessional staff I never even wan to go to Vegas again."

This time I was a little disappointed. Check in was great as always but when I got to my room it was still occupied and dirty! I went back downstairs to advise the front desk clerk and she was questioning me as if it was my fault the room was dirty and still occupied. She keep telling me the room shows her available and clean and wanted me to go back to the room and wait for housekeeping. I was furious, but didn't explode. I simply told her to get their housekeeping staff in order and to do their job correctly, find me another room or cancel my reservations. She gave me another room. I go back upstairs and that room was clean but had no towles, soap or bathroom tissue. By this time, I'm extremely tired and frustrated. I just called housekeeping and had someone bring the items missing in the room. I will be submitting a formal complaint to the company/hotel directly because that is just unacceptable. I like the hotel and want to continue using them but after this my interest has changed."

Everything was going well, until last night. On my last night I decided to go to bed early, so I took my medication and as soon as it hit me the fire alarm on my floor started going off. I had to go down to the lobby to find out what was happening, and then my key decided not to work. So I had to go back down again, and have security take me back up. I was completely exhausted, and security was on top of it! Thank god for them! I will stay there again, that's for sure, Jeff Rutkin"

Upon entering the casino area to check in, we were hit with a horrible smell. We had to walk from one end to the other to check in. The smell was everywhere! The ceiling looked as though it could cave at any time. The smell made us all nauseous gave us headaches. The room was clean, the beds okay. The location was great to hit Fremont street. We chose not to eat, gamble, or do anything in the building, but walk to from our room. Pretty sure we won't be staying there again."

I had problems with the front desk been rude well this time it was no different I asked for non smoking and it specifically says it there and they stated they had no non smoking rooms available anymore and I had my daughter with me now I know that Vegas is no place for a child but last minute my babysitter cancelled and we had everything arranged to go so we had to. So I tell them and she says that she has only smoking but that they would send someone to deodorize my room I waited an hr no one shows I call the front desk to see what's going on they said she was on her way and again no one shows after half an hour I called again and again until I got tired no one ever showed so I sprayed the place with my own stuff and it smelled better I don't understand why am asked what kind of room I want if am going to be given whatever they want not caring upon my request

We enjoyed all the downtown Vegas had to offer. Our only complaints about the room were that the restroom did not have a vanity mirror.

Plenty of chairs to relax in, roulette tables, and a food truck...its a cool little hang out spot! We absolutely would stay here again!"

But then you can rely on the Cleaning Lady, because she can't speak/understand English. All can say is I do not know, go downstairs when you ask her a question. Also the big NO..NO for me is she open my door with her own keycard without asking and that was 9:00 in the morning. Oh I like the lay out of the bathroom but the sink is too high ( square sink on top of the counter) NO FRIDGE / NO MICROWAVE / NO COFFEE MAKER (20.00 per Night if you request one coffee maker they don't have Tea)"

Then I was given a King room when I requested 2 queens. Got moved to the new room only to find out our keys wouldn't open that door and had to go back down to the desk to resolve that issue. The front desk person had an attitude the whole time. When we finally got into our room, (almost an hour after arriving) and it was dirty. There was hair all over the bathroom floor, sink, and tub. Also, I found dried urine on the floor by the toilet. When I called the front desk to complain, the night manager had an attitude. They sent someone to clean and he didn't know what he was doing. He was rude to me. He picked up the hair, but didn't use any cleaners. I will not be staying at The Plaza again. I DO NOT recommend anyone else stay there either."
