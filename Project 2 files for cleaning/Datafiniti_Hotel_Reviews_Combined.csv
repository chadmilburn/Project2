There was still trash in the bathroom when we checked in. Housekeeping did not want to send anyone to take out the trash or bring more towels. The towels were frayed. Our non-smoking room stank of cigarette smoke. There was no coffee maker. Our receipt from hotels.com said there was room service, but there was no room service. We forgot an item, but when we called to see if they found it and could return it, we were told, Sorry, the lost and found is only open M-F, 8-5. Not one employee acted as if we were in any way valued guests. I'm glad we only stayed the one night. I will never stay there again and I will tell everyone I know about the horrible time we had there.",

Frustrating until we learned the right people who had the time and information to help us. Those people where amazing! 1 person for our 3 days that was helpful at each of these locations. Front desk day 3, rewards card day 3, housekeeping day 3, bartender day 3. Got our coupon book on day 3 before the flight and I finally played some tables. These customer service issues aren't a problem for us as we now know how to deal with it but I worry for your over all customer base.

You can tell the hotel is a bit older and they have done renovations on it. Some items, like the elevator and furniture in the rooms show clear signs of wear but not terribly so.

Always like Fremont Street for people watching and all the shows going on! A great vibe with folks from all over, friendly and vibrant. The pool was redone and very nice.

When we checked in the staff was severely overloaded, there were two people at the front desk and probably 100 people checking in.

1 Main St,Hotels,Las Vegas,36.171617,-115.146375,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,89101,NV,May,4.0,Went for Punk Rock Bowling. Right in front of the Fremont Experience. Pretty cool. Parking is free once you check in and they'll reimburse the money you used to enter the first time. Bathroom had no window which was weird but got used to it. The best part was live bands playing at the pool. Freakin Angelic upstarts played for free. Dope,

1 Main St,Hotels,Las Vegas,36.171617,-115.146375,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,89101,NV,July,3.0,I can't be too hard on this hotel because I had an idea of what I was getting into. It looks like it's stuck in the 70's. You can see where some remodeling has been done and is continuing to be done - but keeping up appearances doesn't seem to be urgent. The pool is okay (good for wading) but will deteriorate over time. It's overrun with children and likely local guests. The hallways also had a not so fresh scent. My room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort. As someone who enjoys spending time in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh! Didn't try the dining options - I recommend eating at Main Street Station for the buffet. Casino floor is very smoky. Obviously right at the Fremont experience if that is what you are looking for. Will likely never stay here again.,
1 Main St,Hotels,Las Vegas,36.171617,-115.146375,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,89101,NV,July,4.0,"Even though it's right there across the street from the Fremont Experience with all that noise and energy, the room was quiet and nice.(Be aware! During special times like around New Year's, where bands are playing all the time, it might be loud....that was my experience at the D, the Grand, and another hotel. I cannot guarantee it won't be loud here too I just don't know.) Anyway, no complaints. at all.",

Have to place towel to seal the door to prevent the wind escaping inside and creates annoyinunog loud noise. It works! For the price it's affordable, reasonable and saved lots of money.

1 Main St,Hotels,Las Vegas,36.171617,-115.146375,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,89101,NV,July,3.0,"Check in took over an hour because they were severely understaffed. There was no breakfast as indictated, we had to find a restaurant. The building was renovated but there was a wrapper stuck to the window behind the currents overlooking the Fremont Experience block. The north wing takes a different elevator than the south wing. The parking garage has its own elevator that you must use which is on the opposite end of the plaza from where the elevators are you must use to get to your rooms. The kiosk to check in for yiur flights was down, but the check in people helped in printing out our tickets in their office. Everyone was polite and professional.

Received a call from chase and asked if i made several purchases the next morning and that is how i discovered the breech.

The hotel is being renovated and I was in a newly renovated room. If you don't mind the basics and care more about the price then this might work for you. The room itself was half renovated--one of the chairs was old and gross but the room is pretty basic. It's like a fancy Motel 6. My friend was on a budget otherwise I definitely would not have stayed here. The pool was closed--was only open to some people but the guy who worked there wouldn't even let me look through the glass door at the pool. He was rude. I asked if I could look through the glass door to check out their new pool and he said no the pool was closed--it was five minutes to 7 and they close at 7. Yikes. The fire alarm went off when we were there. One of the staff told us we could ignore it. My friend was concerned so we went to the front desk to find out. No one would talk to us and we had to wait to get someone's attention. It took a long time before we found out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear.

I knew my boyfriend and I were not going to be in the hotel very long, so I didn't expect 5 star, but I didn't want a 1 star dirty Motel 6 either. I chose this hotel because 70 for a deluxe king sounded great. Photos looked great and looked modern. We arrived at the hotel around 10pm, and waited in line for 15 minutes to check in. Upon checking in, the lady at the desk said they had no king beds available, as booked, but only 2 double beds. Fine. When we got in the room... one of the lamps was unplugged, and we shortly discovered the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging/unplugging it. The 2 double beds had 2 small square pillows each... definitely had to double them, and use 2 each.

The bathtub was clogged, we asked to unclog it and they left a mess without cleaning it up. Dirt all over the tub, and it gets worse. The bathtub still remained clogged after their snaking attempt. The lights in the room are bad, they only had 2 lamps and no ceiling light so room remained with little light. THEY CHARGE A HIDDEN FEE! We stayed for 3 nights and we got charged 82 in extra fees without warning. We have stayed in many hotels before and they usually warn us when there are parking fees or any fees.

They did not tell us that they gave us different rooms at check in, so we found out once we got to our rooms. I called room service and front desk and all that they said was it was booked up so they couldn't give either of double beds hung up on me. Had to call again to ask for a roll in bed, since I didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me. They only had one and so my friend didn't get one but luckily i did for my room. And the lady on the phone in room service was really rude and short with me. Elevator situation was a disaster, especially after the festival. I think only a couple of them worked and stair access was not really existent unless for emergency exiting. They also refused late checkout saying they were booked the next day even though they messed up my reservation. The new pool was pretty nice and clean and well put together. Though most of the pool is in shade by noon from its own hotel building of the plaza. Cleanliness and location were fine. I'll probably consider a different hotel next time.

Checking out next morning was a nightmare, people complaining of various situations and still having to wait in line for awhile, this time at least they had 2 people at the front desk!

She said that she had to email a tech to come in for repairs and when I asked her how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know. Due to minimal sunlight into the bathroom I had no other choice but to shower in complete darkness. I was in Vegas for a family reunion so I was gone most of that day and about 3hrs after I left the room I got a call from the front desk to inform me that there was a water leak in my room and that they were moving us to the room next door. What scared me the most was the fact that the water leak might have been causing the light to short out and that there might have been a possibility of getting electrocuted while I was showering.

On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway.

The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel.

When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels.

An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy.

Toilet was leaky and loud, the TV was dated, and there were updates being performed at the time of stay. Other than than it was worth the money. Good: The proximity was great because it was easy to access and close enough to the strip. They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food.

This hotel was chosen by the couple, so we weren't sure what to expect. The staff was pleasant enough. Upon entering, we immediately noticed how strongly it smelled of smoke (much stronger than any other casino we've ever been in). Our room was spacious enough and clean, though dated somewhat in appearance. The toilet in our bathroom leaked a bit and the brass towel racks were all scratched up as well. The wallpaper was peeling off in a spot or two. Our toiletries were not replenished at all during our stay, but we didn't bother to call about it. The price of course is ridiculously low. My husband and I aren't big gamblers, so thought we would enjoy some time by the pool. We were surprised at how small the pool was and that there were no poolside servers. It is more like any backyard pool rather than a pool for a large casino. There is a TGI Fridays near the pool, which we were able to get drinks from and ate at a couple of times. The food and service there was very good. There is a bar by the pool, but it wasn't open at all during our 4 day stay. This property is a good 30 minute ride from the strip, which is about a 50 cab ride one way! For us personally, we would much prefer to stay closer in as we like to site see and visit different restaurants. The pool is also a large deciding factor for us as well.",Georgia

Their deluxe rooms are sub par, the ones with the golf view are somewhat better and worth the money. The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us. All of the rooms are spacious, but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable. We never stayed in the one bedroom suite, but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms. The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room. We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite (one of four in the hotel) room 960. We were booked in the Med. suite, but decided to accept the up-sell upgrade and pay the extra 124 per night to check it out. While it is about 1,000 sq ft larger than the Med. the huge common area was wasted on the two of us. The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom. The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains, once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage. The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head. The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall. The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower. I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel. The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water. You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox, I must comment about their toiletries. The shower/bath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box. The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap, but the kicker was the hand/face soap. It was a little round disc in a plastic package. When I opened it to use it, I thought it was a recycled soap piece! It had no lather and was just crap. If anyone from the property reads this, you really need to re-think these products as they scream CHEAP. The rest of the facility is a midstream casino/resort experience. Granted, you are not on the Strip, but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area. The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent. The Deli. offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu. There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we didn't try. The pool appears to be small for the property, so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it. The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking. Overall, not a bad place, but just OK.Thank you for posting your comments on your recent stay. I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address. I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer. Have a nice day.",Florida

The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review.

Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks.

On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!",

However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.",

The casino was well-ventilated and equipped with all the standard gaming.The breakfast buffet was a bargain for we mature folks. The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip.,

Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days.

The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent.

The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains.

Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there.

The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons.

That is understandable. My stay at the Suncoast lost its glitter when I was told I had to pay for a boarding pass to be printed. I could not believe that they do not include this courtesy for their guests. A daily charge of 5 was charged to my credit card. The explanation was that includes all local calls, a safe in the room, a small refrigerator and wi-fi. As far as I am concerned the refrigerator could be removed as a inclusion. I had a room that was extremely noisy and asked to be moved. It took them hours to get this accomplished. I refused to gamble there after being told about the charge for the printing of the boarding pass. We had dinner at the Red Rock and I decided to try and see if they would print my pass for me. I didn't think they would do it but I was shocked. They never asked me for money or even if I was staying there at the hotel as a guest. I explained to the desk clerk what had happened and they couldn't believe it. I was told they print lots of boarding passes for people as a courtesy not just guests of their hotel. This finished me with the Suncoast. I will never dtay there again while in Vegas. It's the principle of the thing that matters. They could have gained my respect and lots more business from my office. There is no reason for this to happen. It is not good PR at all. The Red Rock has all of my future business.

I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children.",

I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!",Ohio

I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas. Pictures are Views from our room 455.

I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!",California

It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!",California

Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments.

My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast.",

A big, impressive building but understand that it is about a good 20 minute drive on expressways to get to the strip. You will be at the extreme northwest section of the Las Vegas area making it time consuming to get to other parts of the city, but from what we saw this is probably the nicest area in greater Las Vegas (shopping, golf courses, restaurants). Good amenities at the Suncoast, the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value. Bowling center, movie theatre, nice pool/spa area. Our only reservations concerned the (standard) room we had. The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up.

I have to say that rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel.

We like the location, off the strip in more of the residential area. The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas.

The element is a new, clean and quiet hotel. The staff was so friendly, and Sergio at the front desk made you feel like he would do anything for you. The rooms are large and comfortable and most even have their own kitchen.",CT
75 East Harmon Avenue,"Resorts,Hotels Motels,Hotel",Las Vegas,36.1075,-115.1693,Marriott's Grand Chateau,89109,NV,September,5.0,"We stayed on this time share property thru a family member. We stayed on a corner 2 bedroom suite with views of other casino buildings on the strip. Check-in and out was quick with no lines. Staff members are friendly and accommodating. Our room was clean and has all the amenities for a typical condo time share property. My kids did not attend the children's program /play ground but we always see kids with attendants on the play area every morning from our room. The pool was small and I wish it was larger considering that it is a time share property and most of their guests are families with kids. Parking (valet only) is free which is great considering that MGM properties on the strip charged for parking. My main complaint is the long wait for getting our car. We always waited for at least 15 minutes or longer to get our car. The longest was during our check our which is around 10:00 AM when we waited at least 40 minutes, I guess its the check out time.We are delighted that you found our associates friendly and accommodating. We appreciate your feedback of your stay. Thank you for your perfect review of Marriott's Grand Chateau.",California

This was our first time ever to stay at our home property. The service was wonderful, the staff pleasant, and the suites beautiful. It wa a wonderful stay. Two critiques, 1. the movie that was played in the evening was rated PG13, and our small children 3 and 6 were not able to stay in the pool because of it, and when we went to the other pool, it was a lot of young adults smoking and drinking.Thank you for a perfect review, Cat! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your villa here at Marriott's Grand Chateau. Your feedback is very important to us and has been shared with our senior resort management.",Massachusetts

Stayed in a very nice 2 bedroom 2 bath unit plenty of room for the 2 of us. The staff was fantastic. 2 pool areas, one on the 5th floor and the other was on the 387h floor, roof top. Both has full bars and served food.. Location was a half block from the Strip, across the street from Planet Hollywood. Lounge in the lobby and a deli. Would definitely stay there againMichael, we are so happy to hear you are enjoying your Ownership. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a perfect review.
